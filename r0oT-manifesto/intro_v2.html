<h1><center>a quick introduction to r0oT</center></h1>
<br><br>
<h2>1.What is the problem?</h2>

The Earth ecosystem, or what is left of it, is under the most serious danger. We, humans, are part of it, so we are in real danger too. The climate change is already here and its consequences are going to be extreme. After decades of postponing our actions, despite scientists advising us to decrease our pollution rates, we now have very little time to try to avoid the most lethal of the possible outcomes. In order to achieve this, radical, quick and global changes are needed. The current state of most humanity is in no better shape, with acute inequalities in wealth, health and opportunities. The climate crisis, left to itself, will only increase those differences, leading to the most catastrophic scenario humanity has ever seen. It doesn't just sound scary: it is scary. And real. The further we continue looking away, the worst the problem will be when reality will force our sight on it.<br><br>

The neoliberal, ultra-capitalist system that permeates almost all the political map is in full frontal confrontation with our required actions. The idea of constant growth is in full contradiction with a planet already at its resource limits. The concept of an unrestrained market is a lethal enemy to our urgent necessity of self-restrain. The actions to stop polluting the atmosphere, to create sustainable ways of living, to reallocate people where sea rise, heavily-failing crops or extreme drought occur cannot be less profitable and hence uninteresting for the capitalist mindset. <br><br>

Climate change and deep human inequalities are two faces of the same problem. The problem is that most people and the whole ecosystem are under the vicious control of a few people who are just interested in profit. The state of Earth and billions of people is nothing they care about. They will suffer the climate change as well, but will be the last to feel its consequences. And they know it. 

<br><br>

Most humanity and nature have now a global and common goal: to save the Earth in its current life-friendly form, and by extension, to save ourselves. And we also have a global and common enemy: unfettered capitalism. The good news is that our combined force is astronomically higher than the sum of all corporations and their government allies together, but right now this force is disordered, ill-informed and with an almost zero net sum. Our first goal: starting to coordinate ourselves to unfold our true power to fight for our own interests. 

<h2>2.Why is it so important?</h2>

When we say 'climate change' we can think that we will be there to evaluate what will change. When we say 'global warming' we even see a nice aspect of it, since we all want to live with some warmth. Even when we say 'climate crisis' we can think of it as an opportunity, or as something that sooner or later will be overcome. But this time, there may be no one to evaluate the damages, or to learn from the mistakes. From what is at stake, we shall call our problem the 'serious climate threat' or even the 'probable climate end'. By comparison, which problem or issue can compete with this nowadays? If you think this is a problem that can wait, or that it is secondary, you are wrong. If you think there are other problems comparatively similar in importance, you are completely wrong. If you are a climate change denier, you are either extremely badly informed or deeply involved in taking profit from the global disaster, or both things. If you have children, or plan to have, you should consider this problem as a big and most probable life-threat to them. <br><br>

We all do a lot of stuff and have very little time to be concerned with Earth or climate issues. However, all the stuff we do can be done thanks to the planet we live in. Only a vicious or oversimplified logic can ignore to put our common problem at the top priority in our everyday lives. If astronomers would tell us that a huge asteroid would impact us twenty years from now, would we continue our lives as before? Wouldn't we start preparing, forcing our governments to act, and change governments whenever they refuse to listen? Our current problem is of the same magnitude, with a less exact date of impact but with the same catastrophic consequences. <br><br>

You are maybe not aware of this because media, which take a big piece of the profit cake, are not interested in showing you this information. In fact, they actively block it. Governments don't want you to know either. The whole ultra-capitalist strategy is to keep you away from this very important set of knowledge, because they know that the day we are all aware of it, their billion-profit era must end. 

<h2>3.Why is this so urgent?</h2>

Even if you are aware of the problem, you may not be aware of how urgent it is. Many people say they can ignore it and look away because they will be dead by then. Others simply cannot focus their attention on an exam that is two months away, so how can we put our full effort to a problem that will show its face, if geographically lucky, some twenty years or so in the future? Moreover, the famous Climate Paris Agreement stated that we should hold our global warming within the 1.5-2ºC limits. This is a true but somewhat misleading piece of data. From winter to summer we experience changes in temperature that are much higher than 2ºC (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), so why should we worry by a simple 2ºC increase? Again, intentional lack of crucial information is playing into this. <br><br>

With such seemingly small change, wild and extreme weather will be more and more common. Crops will start to fail massively, and guess who have already patented highly-resistant genetically modified seeds? When the time comes, you will need to pay a fortune to eat from them and you will not allowed to plant them without paying the big biotech companies who patented them. We are also talking of extreme droughts and massive migration, which should be called desperate runaways, with an increase of related warfare. The sea level rise will drain many coastal cities and ruin enormous pieces of land with salted water. This and more disasters are coming with just these 2ºC. And many experts say we have passed this threshold and that we are already driving the road to a 4ºC increase or beyond.<br><br>

By far the most urgent issue is our ignorance of where the tipping points of the ecosystem are. Currently, temperature seems to be more or less stable only because most extra-heat is devoted to melting ice. Ice is buying us some extra time. But this ice is rapidly melting, and when this happens, this thermal cushion won't be available anymore. Past this point, the rate of temperature increase will accelerate beyond control. Furthermore, the ecosystem, being such a complex and non-linear system (this means that a little stimulus can trigger big consequences), can amplify by itself our man-made effects once we surpass certain limits that we don't know where are they exactly. It is possible that the ecosystem is a little more robust that we think, but it is possible that it is, in fact, much less. And almost all recent scientific measurements point in the latter direction, in observing Earth-reactions that surpass our worst predictions.<br><br>

In summary: what we know is scary, but what we don't know yet should inspire even more fear. The laws of capitalism, economy, politics... they all can be rewritten. The laws of Nature are not under our control. For a long time, the capitalist mindset, even the modern mankind mentality, has been focused on 'man controlling nature'. It is time we acknowledge that Nature is by far stronger than us. Even if we can damage a whole planet, we cannot control it. We need to shift our minds towards less control and more respect. 

<h2>4.What is r0oT?</h2>

OK, you may feel overwhelmed a bit by now. But this feeling only benefits those who want to keep the current state of things, because it leads to inaction. Your pessimism is key to powerful companies and big-profit interests. And as long as the inaction continues, they will be free to keep filling their pockets. Even if you would like to do something you could ask: where to begin? who I can address? what can I do? There are many NGO's that are doing a great task to alleviate a little bit the worst consequences of the system, but you are right if you think that, in the long term and in the big perspective, they are only applying patches. No NGO alone has the power to confront the big powers, and it's not their fault, of course. <br><br>

So what is r0oT, then? r0oT is a structure which will allow our little individual forces to sum to a gigantic total force. Our latent, hidden forces are all oriented at random, or simply disoriented. The total outcome of this is just inaction, disorder and from a practical point of view, paradise for profit interests. Despite what those interests want to make us think, people, most people, are not bad. Quite the opposite: most people are nice, or at least well intended. And we deserve a better state of the world, a better present and a better future prospect. But we have two problematic issues: 1) we are highly misinformed and 2) we are highly uncoordinated. As a consequence, we act in the wrong direction and with no collective strength. <br><br>

r0oT provides what humanity lacks: structure, social structure. By joining r0oT you will occupy a node in a carefully designed network, so without an extra effort on your part, global coordination can be automatically achieved. The r0oT network has been engineered to possibly allocate all people on Earth within just 13 layers of organization, making simple what it seems impossible at first sight. Through the network, in which each node is a person, and in which <i>each node is as important as any other</i>, free information will flow. Free information that is not being taught in schools (where schools exist at all), not being broadcasted (and or actively blocked) by media and not easily available without some help. <i>The main role of r0oT is to make critical thinking available to everyone</i>, and this implies to learn not just knowledge, but also how to purge ideas from our minds that are designed to benefit the big-profit entities. With an enhanced critical thinking, people will naturally start fighting for their own, collective interest, which includes, as a first priority, fighting for Earth as a whole. What we are doing today is, instead, working for the big profit of a few while earning minimal wages in miserable conditions, if lucky... Or working and enjoying a first-world bubble unaware of the extreme damage we are half-consciously inflicting on the rest of the world. And be sure: bubbles don't last. In places where there is rampant poverty even children behave like adults, while in first-world territories even grown adults behave as permanent teenagers. Humanity has to mature, globally, while allowing all children to enjoy their infancy for a while.

<h2>5.How can r0oT solve the problem?</h2>

r0oT has two clearly distinguished goals. First, as the network grows, it has to act as a world wide school of thought, to mutually teach each other what is best for us as a whole and how to achieve it. We must learn to awake from the dream of never ending growth and face the limited resources of reality. We need, in fact, to fight a big part of what media and other powers have put in our heads. So we must be brave and, with an open mind, <i>change, undo the manipulation inside ourselves</i>. The information will be created by anyone contributing to it, but there will be mechanisms to ensure that we base all our knowledge on serious science, always trying to make it easy and accessible to everyone. r0oT is created by scientists and with a strong scientific and practical mindset. We believe there is no greater power, and nothing more feared by profit-corporations, than solid education and robust critical thinking. This is the spirit of r0oT. <br><br>

As the network starts growing, coordination will become easier and easier, and a more direct action will be possible. If a company or a government applies a harmful policy, the inner flow of news will spread over all the network and all types of actions, from consumer banning to active lobbying against it will be done until such policy is fixed. No particular interests can stand a chance in front of a coordinated humanity, and no private interest can interfere with the common interests, being the whole ecosystem the absolute top priority.<br><br>

The layers of r0oT provide an onion structure that is formed as follows: inner layers will be specialized in global issues like equality, universality or freedom. Today, our more global forces lack a universal ideology beyond free market policies. We need some type of humanistic metaphysics, rooted deeper than economical or political propaganda. By metaphysics we mean a set of ideas based on universal principles as mentioned above, and also values like respect, peace and a will for a sustainable future. It could be summarized in: <i>Gaia, human rights and human obligations.</i> (Gaia is the short name for the notion of ecosystem as a whole.) No violent or hateful actions can have place ever in r0oT. Intermediate layers can focus more on political or economical issues, but always under the respect of the universal principles grounded at the most inner layers. Finally, the most external layers can deal with more local problems, but by no means less important. While inner layers must be occupied by people from all places in the world, to represent the interests of all, the most external layers will be built by geographically close people. So r0oT can act as a macro cooperative that provides the glue for many already existing local cooperatives. And what's more important: due to this structure, local information can have a global reach through the network, so everyone can have a far-reaching voice, while global information, as critical climate issues, can also reach each home without manipulation or malicious blocking. 

<h2>6.What is your role in r0oT?</h2>

When you join r0oT, you occupy a node in the network. The network will be filled by order of arrival, but later you can move through it towards more internal or external layers, or simply through a given layer. The structure is such that each little group of nodes (never more than 14 and much less for inner layers) form a little cell called <i>station</i>. In fact, you will belong to two stations, one as a coordinator, or <i>agent</i> and one as a coordinated <i>member</i>. Each station will periodically receive <i>reports</i> which are little packages of information. Each station will read it, learn from it and improve if possible, and then forward it to its neighboring stations in the network. The network is totally decentralized because you can only know the people in your stations and the contacts for neighboring stations. There are no servers or centralized control. Each decision affecting the station will be democratically taken by all members plus the agent. Decisions concerning the whole network must be taken by universal voting of all members in the system, but no one will have the information of all the network. <br><br>

So your role is mainly to receive information, learn with an open mind, pass it through your critical thinking filter, let the information change yourself when it is better grounded than your previous view, discuss it with your station partners, help them to understand it if necessary, refine it if possible and forward it. When the network becomes big and mature, these free pieces of information will trigger a planet-scale action, either through our consumption style, our voting or other more direct actions. Information triggers action, and different information will trigger different actions. That is why in r0oT we say that <i>informaction</i>(=information+action) is what flows through the network. Of course, individuals and stations are encouraged to introduce inputs of information that can be spread through the whole network.<br><br>

If you have a very fighting mind and consider yourself a true defender of Earth and humanity, you can choose to enter the <i>immunity</i> networks. Humans are easily corrupted, and there are big powers out there eager to infiltrate r0oT and corrupt it. The immunity networks are designed to fight that, not as censorships of free information, but as defenders of the universal principles of r0oT. People trying to put humanity above the ecosystem, or part of humanity in top of the whole humanity must be kicked out from the system, even though they will always be allowed to re-enter from the outer layers again. Immunity members will also help to maintain the simple rules of r0oT with fair play. This immunity thing may bug you, but think about it. Your body would live just hours without a very robust immune system. And as nice as we are, what we must not be are fools. r0oT is about peace and well-being, but being radical about it, because we have been nice and foolish for too long and now are facing a very big trouble.

<h2>7.What is the time investment needed to participate?</h2>

Surprisingly, you don't need an extraordinary investment to participate in r0oT, neither in terms of energy or time. Of course, at the first stage of growth you can, at the moment of joining, state, if you like, that you want to help develop the network. But most of you will just want to enter the network and start learning and sharing, and that's perfectly reasonable. Your main compromise is to stay in (online) contact with your station partners within 24/48h. Inactivity will make the immunity members to reallocate you to the outer layer. The other important commitments are to read the information, to discuss it and to process it before forwarding. As a simple member in one of your two stations, you will help the 
agent (coordinator) to do these tasks. As an agent in your other station, you will be the responsible to coordinate the other members and to keep the reports alive. Each report will have a timing: some of them will leave you a lot of time for it to be discussed and re-sent, while others will be of more urgent character. However, more urgent will require less processing, so this will not increase the workload. <br><br>

An estimation of time can be a dedication of about 1h every 2 days. This is about the 2% of your time. But this is also about 100% of your chances of a better immediate future. So before thinking how much stuff you already have, dedicate a minute to think which priority should r0oT have on your list. Of course, it would be ideal for people to dedicate even more time on this, and many people will certainly do it, but no one can blame you for not dedicating more than this common minimum. 

<h2>8.How can you join?</h2>

Joining r0oT couldn't be easier. There are different entry-doors already and there will be more with time. One simple way is to send an email to r0oT@tutanota.com or to join.r0oT@tutanota.com. Notice that the first '0' is a numerical zero, while the next is just the letter o! You just need to write "hello, let me in" and you're done. However, you may want to tell us whether you prefer to enter the immunity networks, or what are your main strengths, or specialist profile. The idea is to build specialist subnetworks to help technical knowledge to be divulged more easily and to help some technical work to be better coordinated. So you can tell us: "Hey, I want to enter the main network, and my specialty is farming." And that's all! At this moment you can also join a discussion group in the matrix.org network, which can also serve as an entry point. You can enter there, ask all your questions and then join. To do this you may need the Riot app or to go to riot.im website and open an account, and once inside to search for the r0oT discussion room, with the address #r0oT:matrix.org  In any case, once you enter the network you will spend some time learning about the technical details. And you can get out whenever you want, and re-join as many times as you like. Plus, <i>you will be never asked for money</i>. If you do, just get out from there.<br><br>

If you are concerned about anonymity, you can connect through Tor by downloading the Tor browser so you can create the Tutanota account there and send you email from it. You can connect to matrix.org through Tor as well. However, such precautions are not strictly necessary. It depends on you.<br><br>


We are sure that many times you have thought to change the world but said "what can I do, alone?" And it's true, alone you can do little, but all together we can do <i>a lot</i>. <b> <i>We have a problem. So important and urgent, that it is just 'the problem'. But we have r0oT and we can solve the worst part of it, and come up with a better and more just system for all living creatures.</i></b>
