"Why genes are not selfish and people are nice" [PN] (2013), by Colin Tudge. ISBN 978-086315-963-3. Floris books.

This book is, in part, an answer to "The selfish gene" (1976) by Richard Dawkins. In The Selfish Gene [SG] the author summarizes a neo-Darwinian school of thought based on the idea that the key player in natural selection  is not the individual but the genes themselves. Genes compete and cooperate to persist in time, sometimes against the individual itself, who becomes the machine that carries and propagates the genes, sometimes against each other inside the same organism, as in the case of the Gestational diabetes, in which the fetus competes against its mother. We can, for example, understand individual altruism in terms of gene selfishness. The SG theory is backed by game theory in which simple mathematical models aim to describe social interactions. These games are themselves related to the famous Prisoner's dilemma, in which "two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so" [wikipedia definition]. From a naive mathematical perspective, cooperation yields the maximum benefit to all, but this is shown to be non-stable because it allows non-cooperative people [hawks] to proliferate and easily taking advantage of cooperating people [doves]. An equilibrium is reached that metaphorically describes the current world economics in which  we have the following recent news:

The book by Tudge, PN, starts by analyzing the neo-Darwinian school of thought, in which the competition aspects of natural selection dominate over the cooperation mechanisms. This, always following Tudge's opinion, allows corporates and governments to justify their predator principles and their lack of consideration to the rest of the world. But cooperation is much more important and it needs to be reconsidered as more fundamental than competition.

So I proceed to paraphrase some extracts trying to capture the spirit of the book, with an emphasis on Root's own interests.

"I want to present a different view of life - compounded of ideas that in most important respects are completely opposed to the kinds of beliefs that now dominate the world as a whole. For we in the western world have misconstrued [...] the nature of the universe, of life and of our own human selves."

"We treat the world badly, we treat each other badly."

"Our politics is unjust, our economic system borders on the insane, our governments for the most part are not on our side, our science which should be our great liberator has become the handmaiden of big business, while religion is all over the place, fractious and narrow-minded where it should be all-embracing."

"The ideas that dominate and underpin our lives are the stuff of the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age."

"Part  of the point of this book is [...] to explore the ideas of the modern Zeitgeist and see if they really stand up. Most of them do not."

"This book emerges as an exercise in metaphysics; for its goal is to find out what is true, and what is good."

"The loss of metaphysics from western thinking is at the root of all our troubles." [Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Man and Nature]

"Neo-Darwinists or ultra-Darwinians have picked up on Darwin's idea that natural selection is driven by competition and concluded that all life is inveterately competitive. [...] This idea dominates the western world. It is the lynch stone of the global, neoliberal, all-against-all economy. But actually, it's not true."

"The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind pitiless indifference." [Richard Dawkins]

"This is [...] to reject the concept of transcendence."

"Transcendence is  [...]  there is more to the universe than meets the eye."

"Transcendence is the notion that underpins and unites all religions [even Buddhism and Confucianism which have no God]".

Neo-Darwinians are materialists and fundamentally atheists.

"Yet faith in science has led to the even more pernicious faith in high technology, the belief that it will make us omnipotent."

"The idea is to justify the prevailing economic strategy, based on endless material growth."

"But nature is beyond our ken and well beyond our control."

"Anthropocentricity is the idea that human beings are the only creatures that really count, and the rest may be treated as resources [today this is taken as self-evident]. " Abrahamic religions have favoured this notion. We are guilty of the original sin and we are as human beings, bad. Neo-Darwinians suggested that we must be bad since we are bound to compete, condemned to do each other down.

"The notion that we are all vicious at our core has in turn allowed priests and politicians to lord it over us."

"All hierarchies insist that they are necessary [...] for our own good. [...] We allow them to get away with this."

"We have a ludicrous concept of progress, conceived in materialist terms."

"The number 1 goal of all present governments is to generate wealth, [...] economic growth."

"Nature must be treated as a resource which in turn can be turned into commodities to be sold for money."

"People who don't subscribe are hippies or backsliders or romantics." They follow paths shown to have failed in the past.

"If we get our ideas straight, in line with our own feelings, and act accordingly, our descendants should still be here in a million years time and still enjoy the company of our fellow creatures. The stakes are very high."

"Several thousand years of pessimism." Plato: self-evident that the majority of us, were not to be trusted with anything that required serious thought. Hobbs: the life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

Malthus: "The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must be in some shape."

The population grows much more rapidly than resources.

All this pessimism shapes the ideas through the centuries and when Darwin proposes its natural selection theory, its interpretation is pessimistic.

The studies on ants, bees and other populations [summarized in the SG book] "is good science".

"But it's important to see where the science ends and the rhetoric begins."

"We are indeed influenced by our genes but is it helpful, is it right, to suggest that life is simply  a hierarchy, ruled by a boss called DNA?"

"We are survival machines [...] programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes." [Dawkins]

"The answer is 'No'."

"The descriptive 'selfish' is a shameless piece of anthropomorphism. [...] But anthropomorphism applied to DNA is merely sensationalist."

"The rhetoric springs not from science but from pre-conceptions of philosophical, political, sociological and poetical nature."

"Although competition is an inescapable theme of life the essence of life is cooperation."

"The whole thesis of the selfish gene is in truth an uneasy amalgam of dubious scientific interpretation and rhetoric."

Many times natural selection acts without competition at all.

Even the question what is life? is not clear.

The foundations of life reveal great cooperation between molecules to form a cell, for instance. Or the huge cooperation between cells to form complex organisms. How can competition be the dominant dogma?

"We can still argue if we like, as Dawkins does, that the marvelous collaboration that is an oak tree or a human being is just an extrapolation of a selfish molecule striving to reproduce. But such a view is not, in itself, science. It is rhetoric."

"No animal is an island".

"Sociality in animals brings huge advantages, and sociality requires intelligence." Unless hardwired like in ants or bees.

Sociality must has been naturally selected.

Jane Goodall: Chimps cannot be explained as if they were robots. We need to empathize with them.

"Empathy is real." It exists between different species as well.

Darwin: there is no human quality , including the most admirable, that cannot be found in some form or other in other animals.

The author briefly reviews the Gaia theory by James Lovelock.

The Gaia hypothesis: the whole Earth is an homeostatic organism. This is even beyond cooperation: is to consider that all organisms cooperate in a giant-all embracing- supra-organism. At least, Gaia is analogous to an organism.

There is absolute interdependence between plants, fungi, bacteria, animals, etc.

The composition of the atmosphere is a sign of the life that thrives in it.

Reviews of Gaia books by Lovelace need to be done. The main idea is that we live under homeostatic conditions, but such protection is feeble and we are probably going beyond them, wrecking the whole organism.

Berthold Brecht: the rich need the poor more than the poor need the rich, but the poor don't realize that yet.

Matt Ridley [The origins of virtue]: we are eusocial.

"As primates, we are innately social animals. But we more than social." Eusocial means super-social. "We cannot live without the company of other people."

David Kahneman  [2002 Nobel Prize for his ideas on human cooperativeness][Thinking, fast and slow]: results in experiments suggest that our intuitive selves are much nicer than our more slow-rational selves.

"This seems to be gains the Enlightment view , which still seems to guide modern politics, which says that human beings are nasty until the smoothing hand of reason is applied."

"The one economics Nobel Laureate who seems to be taken seriously is Milton Friedman, the champion of neo-Darwinian neoliberalism. Hmm."

"Sociality clearly aids survival, and so, in practice, it does. "

"Social animals maintain their societies through all kinds of protocols and rituals. Since sociality requires giving as well as taking, we would also expect natural selection to favour generosity."

"We would expect social animals [...] enjoying the giving as well as the taking."

"We would expect evolution to favour love, in short, to provide the essential social cement."

Anne Frank: It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything I still believe people are really good a heart.

"Neither is true, as conventional economists and politicians seem to find it convenient to suppose, that human beings are particularly materialist. Most of us are far less concerned about the size of our car and of our house and garden than we are about our family and friends. Those who put material things first we think are odd, and indeed sociopaths."

"It is true and obvious that if we are starving in the gutter then feel much better if our material status improves, so that we can eat well and have a roof over our heads. But once we have achieved life's basics, plus a bit more, further wealth does not make us happier (unless we are sociopaths obsessed with wealth)."

"Governments pursue this obsessive goal only because they have locked themselves, and therefore locked the rest of us, into a particular form of capitalism that relies on constantly increasing wealth. There is no such thing in the modern economy as a steady state."

"But it is the official line, espoused in high places everywhere, and supported by battalions of highly paid intellectuals."

"Intellectual does not mean sage."

"All human beings, like all thinking creatures, have a touch of Jekyll and Hyde."

"Soldiers returning from war are as traumatised partly because of what war has taught them about themselves."

"What we actually do, day to day, in an organised society like ours, is determined largely by the prevailing political policies and the economic theory. "

"Happiness in the society is greatest in an all-dove society."

"Doves waste no time and energy in fighting."

"But there is a snag. The all-dove society is vulnerable. Without assistance, it cannot be stable in the long term. "

"The wellbeing score of the single hawk in an all-dove society is higher than that of a dove in an all-dove society."

"Sometimes the hawks simply become the aristocracy, or indeed the government. Either way, hawks rise to the top."

R. Wilkinson and K. Pickett [The spirit level]: isolated hawks in otherwise dovish societies are not particularly happy, even though they may be very rich.

"There is not an absolute and irreversible biological difference between the hawks and the doves."

"The hawk-dove model seems to have enormous explanatory power."

"Most of us want simply to get on with our own lives, and really don't want power."

"So most of us are all too content to leave the business of being in charge to those who want to be in charge. But the people who most want to be in charge are the hawks, and they are hawkish."

"As good primates, we have a built-in propensity to follow leaders. But some primates at least [woolly monkeys, gorillas...] get rid of their leaders as soon as they fail to operate in the best interests of the group, or at least they give any would-be bullies a very bad time."

"But in modern societies, even those called democracies, those in power have layer upon layer of protection. Electing leaders is one thing. Getting shot of them when it all goes wrong is something else entirely."

"Sometimes we see dovish people in positions of power or at least of political influence: Gandhi, Mandela, Dalai Lama, Vaclav Havel... But I suggest all of those are or were leaders in societies that were oppressed by some still greater power. India by the British, Mandela by the white supremacists, the Dalai Lama's Tibet by the Chinese..."

"Still, many people in high places are not conspicuously nasty. Virtually all the CEO's I met [in the World Economic Conference] were very nice people, truly anxious to do good. But CEO's, despite their title and their trappings of power, commonly do not make the running in their own companies, any more than presidents necessarily rule the United States. The power is behind the throne: and the drivers in any one company very often are out-and-out hawks, precisely because they are so fixated on personal success. Nice and intelligent people then find themselves driven along by the truly hawkish hawks, and find all kinds of excuses for doing so."

"Intellectuals of all kinds hitch their wagons to the hawkish power-machine and use their learning and their intelligence both to justify the machine and to make it work."

"Worst of all, scientists bend their efforts to support the hawkish elite. This is most evident in agriculture. [...] GM [genetically modified] crops are not necessary. [...] The main point of GM technology is to increase the power and wealth of the biotech companies who make them, and of governments such as Britain's that rely on corporate support. "

"Specifically: governments like Britain's tot up the earnings of the corporates that operate within their shores and call it 'gross domestic product' or GDP; and as GDP increases they call it 'economic growth' which, in this materialist, neoliberal age, is the only measure of success that they take seriously. The means by which the wealth is produced, and whether the wealth actually brings benefit to the society as a whole, or humanity or the world as a whole, is not considered relevant."

"We see at work 2 general phenomena:

1. Natural selection. The lawyers, economists and scientists who oppose the current trend remain unemployed, or seriously underemployed. The ones who thrive are the ones who support the status quo.

2. The other general phenomenon at work is that of the positive feedback loop. Corporates use some of their wealth to employ scientists who will produce the kinds of 'high' technologies that will make the corporates even richer, so they can spend even more money on science that will produce even more tech that will make them richer still, and so on. Governments such as Britain's are content to sit on the sidelines and prime the pumps; using tax-payers money to pay a minority of scientists to do the fundamental research that the commercial scientists can then make use of. As always, the taxpayers take the risks and the corporates take the profits and the governments calls the profits 'GDP`and claims success."

"Things have gone horribly wrong because policy in general is not designed for the benefit of people and the world at large, but to reinforce the power and wealth of the hawkish elite."

"The intellectuals of all kinds have joined this elite, partly because some of them are hawkish themselves and partly because it is hard to find a secure job anywhere else. The noose tightens."

"But there is worse still. Governments and corporates shower us with information which is propaganda. Even worse, governments control education: and nowadays for example it is hard to find any course of biology that is not geared towards biotech, and the commercial joys that go with it."

"The overall effect of all this top-down propaganda is the create and reinforce the Zeitgeist: a worldview based on the idea of reality that is entirely materialist, and which takes for granted that human beings are in a different league and category from all other creatures, that everything else including other creatures is just a resource, and that resources should be turned into commodities to be sold for cash, but that human beings in general are a bad lot and need to be kept in check by a wise and caring political and intellectual elite. But the political and intellectual elite are the hawks, or people who in various ways convince themselves that it is good to work for the hawks, and hawks work for themselves."

"Societies of doves must protect themselves."

"Hawks must be kept in check."

"The human body (in fact all living bodies) have elaborate systems to protect themselves both against invading pathogens and against other body cells that break the bounds and seek to become cancerous."

"With our present global society, sociopaths are in charge. No wonder the world is in a mess."

Metaphysics agenda: three main questions:

1. What is the universe really like?

2. How do we know what's true?

3. What is good? How ought we to behave on this Earth?"

There is a 4: Is there any worthwhile relationship between 1 and 3?

"I believe that the divide between people with a feeling of transcendence and those who reject all such musing is the most profound of all the divisions within humankind."

"The insights of science are wondrous and vital [...] but not sufficient. "

"Evolution cannot be seen simply as a random walk. Nature clearly favours a fairly long shortlist of very particular designs- worm-like, fish-like, mole-like, bird-like, flower-like and repeats them over and over again."

"If each creature is seen as half of the evolutionary dialogue -each a response to the problems the universe poses - then we can in theory reverse-engineer, and infer what kinds of problems the universe is posing. [...]Clearly the universe favours some courses far more than others. It has its own ideas about how things ought to be done."

"Over time, the universe unfolds to realise its own potential, to become itself."

So, is there are purpose, a true evolution? Or there is not, as materialists science usually claim?

"Ultra-materialist scientists tend to argue as if their particular points of view must be the correct, because they emerge from science. But they argue this only because they are not good philosophers, and do not know what science really is, and what it is not."

David Hume: Reason is, and ought to be only the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.

"Cooperation and conviviality are the names of the game. It is a huge serendipity that the best long-term survival tactic, both for individuals and for the human species as a whole, is to be nice."

Socrates: the more we know the more we ought to realise how little we know.

"In the end, life and the universe will always be mysterious. This realisation ought to breed humility. It is rational, in the light of uncertainty,  to proceed cautiously."

The notion of one-ness:
1. We all share the same atoms.
2.Everything that lives on Earth shares the same ancestor.
3.The intelligence that we share with other creatures is part of the fabric of the universe.

"This notion is the antidote to anthropocentricity."

"Those who believe that all life is one cannot reasonably believe that human beings are the only species that counts, and that we have the right to treat the rest as a resource."

"But that is what the present Zeitgeist assumes. In the prevailing jargon, life is called 'biodiversity' and valued only for what it can do for us: 'ecotourism'; 'eco-services'; 'the environment'. The vocabulary itself is vile."

We must give weight to our intuition.

"Our intuition is rooted in our evolved response to the problems posed by the universe this past 3.8 billion years, and it is not obvious why it should lead us astray."

Karl Marx: Philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways, the point however is to change it.

"We must translate the new (but ancient-rooted) metaphysics into action."

"These grass-roots movements begin with groups of friends in the pub."

"To change the world, a 'paradigm shift' is needed, with a critical mass of people who want to do things differently."

"20% of people pulling in the same direction, or even far fewer, can start the sea-change happening."

"We already have the necessary mass, [...] but such mass does not becomes critical unless it coheres. The task, then, is to achieve coherence."

"Coherence must run in two directions: both vertically and horizontally."

"Vertical coherence: conceived by 3 tiers:

1. Metaphysics to change the Zeitgeist.
2.Economic and political theory.
3.Day-to-day realities of life. Professions we must pursue to keep ourselves alive and in good spirits: farming, manufacture, health care, building, teaching, academic theorising, story-telling, and all the rest."

"Horizontal coherence means that the different ideas and pursuits within each tier should be pulling together."

"Metaphysics should again be at the heart of formal education and a leitmotiv of everyday discourse."

"If we acknowledge (as modern biology suggests) that cooperation must trump self-interested competitiveness, then the biology and the morality are perfectly in accord. That is coherence."

Einstein: Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.

"Politics and economics should spring naturally from the underlying metaphysics."

"For the last few decades the world has been guided by the neoliberal thoughts of Milton Friedman."

"We now have an absurd mismatch between the rhetoric of politicians and the economy that they support. The rhetoric calls for peace, social justice, and what is now called 'sustainability'; but the prevailing neoliberal economy requires us to be at each other's throats and to produce more and more stuff as if the Earth was infinite and there is no tomorrow."

"The prevailing economy worldwide is a nightmare. "

"Money itself has become divorced from reality."

"Currently there is deemed to be about 18 times more money in the world than there are material goods to buy. "

"So money is no longer a symbol of real things. It is a pure abstraction. "

"The whole mirage is based on debt. Our own wealth is assessed not in terms of what we actually have, which in turn might reflect what we have actually done that is of use, but on how much we can borrow. "

"The truly alarming thing is that the same people (or the same kind of people) who presided over this disaster [the 2008 crisis] are still in charge."

"The same nonsensical theories and ambitions still prevail, the debt economy, the neoliberal market, the all-out imperative for 'growth'.  The powers-that-be have not learnt the lesson that is so obvious to people at large."

"The errors begin with the fundamentals. Page 1 of all standard economic textbooks invariably tells us that the goal of economics is to make people happy and that happiness is proportional to wealth and that therefore the role of economics must be to maximise wealth. "

"The nonsense is compounded by the failure to acknowledge:
a) that the world itself is finite.
b) that our fellow creatures matter."

"All economies should be rooted in reality, what is necessary to do, and what is possible to do, and by agreed morality, what is right to do. "

"Get the metaphysics right, in short, and the economy should follow. "

"Another nonsense: The very poor are assured that they could be very rich if only they played their cards right, and many clearly believe this, and vote for the very rich while they themselves may live in trailer parks."

"For the alternative to the free market, we are told, are the 'controlled economies' that once were seen in Stalin's USSR and Mao'S China, and today in North Korea. "

"Even the term socialist is now taboo."

"The realistic alternative is 'social democracy'. "
"It is the government's job to moderate the market in the public interest. If they do not do that, it is hard to see what they are for. "

"A market modified in the interests of social justice is social democracy."

"We must beware of intellectuals. "

George Orwell: intellectuals are prone to cling to ideas long after they have been shown to be foolish.

"Democracy implies that the rules and structure of society as a whole reflect what people really want and if one of the main arguments of this book is right, that most people are nice most of the time, then a society that was truly democratic ought to be convivial. "

"The metaphysics is the foundation. Economic and political theory provide the broad guidelines within which we live. But what matter to most of us most of the time is our day-to-day lives; what we actually do."

"The principal goal in all government and commerce these days is to maximise wealth. Even teaching, health care, and wildlife conservation are required to pay their way."

Keynes: big countries can always afford the things they really want.

"In Britain right now we cannot apparently afford social services but we could apparently afford the Iraq and the Afghan wars and we did afford the Olympic games."

"Ordinary Joes, people at large, have to take matters into our own hands. We have to create true democracy."

"How? The are 3 ways.

1. By Reform. Rules are changed until the desired endpoint is reached. This means asking people in power, nicely, to change their ways. This can work up to a point. It's not enough.
2. By Revolution. But is too messy. Much collateral damage and rarely produce the desired results. The result could be terminal to the world.
3. By Renaissance, the one that can really work. "

"Renaissance means re-birth. Start doing things differently despite the powers-that-be. "
