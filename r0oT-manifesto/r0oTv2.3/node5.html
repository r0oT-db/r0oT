informaction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Yes, this is the answer: informaction,  = information + action. 
It is the most important concept in r0oT. There is no use in 
considering information or action in a separated way here. Different information will produce 
different actions, as different causes usually produce different 
effects. And different actions will provide different information in the 
world and how this information is spread through the population. That is 
why we have coined this handy term that already expresses the close
relationship between these two capital concepts. You surely 
have listened or even said 
a thousand times that `people are bad', `people are evil', `we are already 
doomed', `as long as I don't see it, it's OK', and many more sentences 
like that, when thinking about global poverty or climate change. These 
sentences are just pieces of information, and you say them <I>because you 
have listened others saying them</I>. Now ask yourself, what are the actions 
produced by that information? Your are right, no action at all! These 
sentences are clever pieces of information whose effect is to block any 
hope, and by extension, any action to change the world. Now ask yourself again, who benefits 
from such stagnation? Again, you are right, the powers now in charge. If you 
don't act, they can maintain their status quo. So simple. Just as genes 
fight to persist in time through reproduction, memes also reproduce in 
our individual and collective (Zeitgeist) minds. Memes are pieces of 
information, like genes, and they have effects on the real world. The 
effects of a gene is called phenotype, and we don't need to coin a new 
term for memes (like `memotype'). We just consider the phenotype as the 
effect of genes + memes. Well, the action-blocking sentences listed 
before are very effective memes put in our minds by those who benefit 
from them. Don't be surprised: Nature is full of these tricky mechanisms 
at the gene level [<A
 HREF="node12.html#phenotype">31</A>], so why don't we expect them at the meme level? In 
fact, in r0oT we can benefit from it by creating memes that can benefit 
the whole ecosystem and the whole human population. The concept of 
`Gaia' [<A
 HREF="node12.html#lovelock1">32</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#lovelock2">33</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#lenton">34</A>] is in fact such a good meme, as it is `life', `consciousness', `agency', 
`soul', etc. They are very useful concepts that express powerful ideas 
that are nevertheless hard or even impossible to define with a global 
consensus [<A
 HREF="node12.html#life">35</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#agency">36</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#agency2">37</A>].

<P>
The first priority in r0oT is to be a global school, one in which
the main topic to learn is <I>critical thinking</I>, something rarely taught at
regular schools today. Critical thinking (CT) is the only way to make our
decisions free, otherwise we are just being easily manipulated. 
Here we name a few basic aspects of CT or simple steps to enhance it. Take it as
an incomplete suggestion list:

<UL>
<LI>Freedom is not about what you can or can't. For that, there is already the concept of power.
Freedom is about what you <I>really</I> want, in a wide, broad and long term sense. [<A
 HREF="node12.html#heroe">38</A>]
</LI>
<LI>You should question everything you know, read or listen. 
</LI>
<LI>Ask, for every idea you are faced with, who
is getting some benefit from it and who becomes damaged [<A
 HREF="node12.html#zeitgeist">39</A>].
</LI>
<LI>When considering benefits and damages, evaluate not only short but most importantly long term. 
</LI>
<LI>Purge as many manipulative or brain-washing ideas from your mind. This is not an easy task to accomplish, but it is worth trying.
</LI>
<LI>Read the great pillars of CT: From Plato and Aristotle to Montaigne, Voltaire, Spinoza
 and Nietzsche, among many others. Independently of their ideas, they can provide a CT architecture in your brain.
Please excuse our bias towards occidental roots. We are sure other cultures have plenty of classical
works and great authors as well.
</LI>
<LI>Read great literature, from Aeschylus and Sophocles to Shakespeare and Calder&#195;&#179;n, among
an almost infinite list. Those authors have explored the many
 lights and shadows of the human soul. You will know human beings better afterwards, including yourself.
</LI>
<LI>Most visual entertainment, especially TV programs, make you a passive viewer. There are other types of 
entertainment (documentaries, stage arts, ...) that request you an <I>active</I> role as a listener and
as a thinker.
</LI>
<LI>Immerse yourself into the arts, ancient and modern. Arts will help you
to appreciate beauty and will develop your sensibility. Without this, how can you appreciate
the love for Nature and recognize the suffering of other creatures?
</LI>
<LI>Science is not just a technical specialty but the quest to understand the natural world to which we all
belong. It is important to know the basics of the scientific knowledge in order to understand the origins,
the mechanisms and the future of our world.  
</LI>
<LI>Don't take any authority for the sake of of it, even if the words come from a bunch of
Nobel laureates [<A
 HREF="node12.html#laureates">59</A>]. Truth does not need trust. And no one but time can speak in the name of science.
</LI>
<LI>Engage with your close acquaintances in conversations about topics that are relevant to you and your environment.
To dialogue with other people helps to contrast your lines of reasoning with others, so you can enrich them.  
</LI>
<LI>A good CT begins by a strong self-connection. In order to enhance it, you can talk to yourself, 
writing a journal, meditating, ...One of the main reasons of the acute self-disconnection that
we experience today is due to the bad use of our current technological tools. With the promise
of connecting you to the world, you can easily end up disconnected from yourself.
</LI>
<LI>Be balanced in all aspects. Great scientific minds with high IQ's without sensibility or emotional intelligence are
as harmful to the world as great artists with no scientific knowledge. The former can put their
abilities to the interests of big current powers, while the latter can be easily manipulated when
 technical terms matter, and it is usually the case.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

The difficult thing with a poorly trained CT, also called a washed brain, is that a manipulated mind
will not easily recognize that it is so, otherwise it would be less manipulated that it seems. But
there are some hints to recognize strong brainwashing in your head. If you identify yourself
or become irritated with some, you can be quite sure that you have been under significant manipulation:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Since you were born, you were taught that you need meat to be strong, dairies for your bones, fish
for your memory, etc. You were also taught that cows, pigs and chicken, among others, live happily on the fields. The
actual facts are: Animal agriculture and fishing are some the biggest causes of climate change [<A
 HREF="node12.html#cow">9</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#worldwatch">13</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#numbers">14</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#ocean">15</A>].
An animal based diet can damage your own health [<A
 HREF="node12.html#meat1">16</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#meat2">17</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#meat3">18</A>], while a plant based diet prevents many diseases
 and is perfectly viable and healthy [<A
 HREF="node12.html#v1">40</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v2">41</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v3">42</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v4">43</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v5">44</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v6">45</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v7">46</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v8">47</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v9">48</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v10">49</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v11">50</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#v12">51</A>]. It is even compatible with great physical
activity [<A
 HREF="node12.html#vv1">52</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#vv2">53</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#vv3">54</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#vv4">55</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#vv5">56</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#vv6">57</A>]. Last but not least, animals in the whole food industry not only live under deplorable 
conditions, but they also undergo abuse, mistreatment and deep suffering before facing massive slaughter [<A
 HREF="node12.html#gary">58</A>].

<P>
</LI>
<LI>You have nationalist, patriotic feelings of any kind. There is nothing bad in loving
your place of birth, but there is great harm when this acquires political and legal implications. 
There is no single scientific reason to distinguish two people from the place they have 
been born. It is like believing in the horoscope, thinking that one constellation influences
you more depending on your time of birth.
</LI>
<LI>You don't think climate change is real or extremely urgent, being humans the
cause of this [<A
 HREF="node12.html#hoax1">60</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#hoax2">61</A>]. Strong scientific evidence shows the opposite [<A
 HREF="node12.html#nohoax">62</A>].
</LI>
<LI>You buy more clothes and objects than you really need, without knowing where
do they come from and at which human and environmental price, and you just consider that the true price
is the one reflected on the article [<A
 HREF="node12.html#truecost">10</A>].
</LI>
<LI>You are not rich and vote for a right wing party in elections, when their goal is to defend the interests of the richest. If you vote them, you
are actively involved in the building of social inequalities. 
</LI>
<LI>You are not very worried by the values you and schools teach to your children with respect to
the future awaiting for them.
</LI>
<LI>You get irritated by the mere suggestion of being manipulated. A good critical
thinking accepts that manipulation at some level is unavoidable: the goal is to 
reduce it as much as possible, but it first needs acknowledgement of its existence.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
In Figure <A HREF="#fig04">4</A> we have represented the feedback cycles of informaction. One of the
main goals of r0oT is to help accessing free information and building free minds in order to disrupt
the cycle of manipulation that the global powers try to imprint on us everywhere from ads, to 
school programs or news channels. If you consider yourself a person with a high
degree of CT, then you can consider the importance of acting in order to enhance it
in other people. Among all other things, this is what r0oT is aimed to, or at least its first
fundamental step. One of
our lemmas could be that CT is much more important than IQ, and they don't always
come together. So, summarizing, we have an structure to provide coordination and we know what
is flowing through it. The next question is: how are the specific mechanisms of it?

Figure 4: <i>Scheme representing the flows of informaction through the human mind of a stick figure. The
sources of manipulated information arrive to the mind. If these memes do not encounter 
Critical Thinking (CT) resistance, they develop into actions that mostly benefit the meme's authors, not the subject acting. In the same way as a small bird that feeds a relatively giant cuckoo's baby even if
it is blatantly clear that it is not its child \cite{cuckoo}. In many ways we are even more blatantly
manipulated that those birds. However, if these memes encounter CT resistance, they
will not easily progress into actions that favor them, so they will neither reproduce nor
benefit their remote authors. Here, red means manipulation flow, while green is used for
freedom (free from manipulation). Depending on how free is our output we will feed
a red feedback mechanism, benefiting the current powers, or a green feedback
mechanism, in which other powers, better for Gaia and the people, can appear. Many
people think that people are evil, but this is just a very red meme! The truth
is that people are neither evil nor good in an intrinsic way, but strongly
manipulable, ductile and flexible. We need to help each other to bend our wrongly supposed
evil into good actual will. But how can informaction flow following the green feedback loop in order to raise our CT
and, as a consequence, our own freedom?</i>
