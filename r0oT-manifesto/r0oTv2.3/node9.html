immunity</A>
</H1>

<P>
At this point of the description you surely have wondered whether this network can be
robust against attacks, infiltrations of any sort or just external/internal infection or corruption.
The answer is that, 
being made of humans, a bare r0oT network is easily corruptible. Our body would also die very
rapidly if we wouldn't have a strong an efficient immune system. Total immunity
cannot be achieved, of course, and even autoimmune diseases can appear. (Notice
how we are now considering r0oT as an organism, as an organized collection of
individuals that try to work for the global good.) How can we achieve a fair
degree of immunity? Clearly, by creating a parallel and independent network that
can specialize in what immunity means: 1) identify a problem that is threatening the organism, and 2) solve the problem.
The idea is simple, but it can add some complexity to an already complex set of ideas. We
create another network, called <I>i1</I> network, where members are connected in the same
exact way as in the main network. They form stations as well and follow the same dynamics
and principles. But with one additional thing: each station in the main network has always an
i1 member in it, trying to ensure that all the dynamics of r0oT are properly applied and
most of all, trying to identify focuses of informaction manipulation. They can even act
when a member simply is too inactive. But before going into more detail, we show in Figure 
<A HREF="#fig08">8</A> some aspects of the immunity i1 network. In Figure <A HREF="#fig09">9</A> we show how
the coupling between the main and i1 networks occur. 

<P>

The criteria for an i1 member to act are very simple and clear. If a member does not
show in the network as active, it will be reallocated to an external layer, layer 13
if the network is already full, after 3 attempts to contact her/him. If the problem
is the type of activity that the member is performing, then they will follow these criteria:

<UL>
<LI>Gaia, the whole ecosystem, is more important that any of its parts. Humanity,
in this context, is just a part of Gaia. So Gaia has a higher priority than humanity.
After all, without Gaia there can be no humanity at all.
</LI>
<LI>Humanity as a whole comes before any particular subgroup of humans.
</LI>
<LI>Etc. The pattern is simple. The more general the system, the greater its priority.
</LI>
</UL> 
Every action performed by the i1 member of a main station must be approved by the i1 station
to which the i1 member belongs as a station member (and not as a i1 station agent). However, 
if the issue is bigger and affects more than one main station, the i1 network can coordinate
to temporarily perform a fusion of main stations to deal with the problem, and even to perform
a cut and paste of the main network, expelling or reallocating those problematic members. 
If you join r0oT you will able to see the proposed technical details for these complicated
matters, discuss them and work for better versions of them. 

<P>
The cost of building immunity networks is high. We need many more members that instead of
working for the main purposes of the main network, need to be
working for the integrity of the system. We think the effort pays off, because
in r0oT we are fighting very big powers that are well established and with many
resources. It is natural to expect that they will try to discredit this project
from the outside and blow or kill it from the inside. That is why people willing to
enter r0oT will need to include people willing to enter the i1 network as well. As
your real identity is not revealed here, nothing prevents you from opening
multiple accounts, even at the two different networks, main or i1. However, unless you have
a huge amount of time, your efficiency will be below what is desirable.
 However, the cost of the i1 network is much lower than the cost of the
main network. Notice that it is a network coupled with the main one with one
degree of layer shift, so at the main layer 2 we have the first i1 layer, when
we are at main layer 3, we are at the second i1 layer, and so on. Arriving
to the 13th main layer would imply a need of a 12 layered i1 network. Adding
more layers of immunity, i2, i3, etc would cost less and less but would
increase immunity more and more. We think it is justified. Watch the corruption
 around you. The world is plenty of it. Maybe it is one of the main reasons of
the current and deplorable state of Gaia. It's worth the effort. Those of you
who have a clear fighting attitude in favor of Gaia should join the i1 network,
no doubt about it. We need there constructive and radical people with no 
hesitation to act against a behavior that would affect to all.

Figure 8: <i>Depiction of the first four layers of the i1 network. On the left we show
the nodes (hexagons to distinguish from the circles of the main network) and their
connections. We also see that the nomenclature is the same as in the main network except
for the fact that we add the label i1 as the first 2 digits. On the left we can see the
stations that i1 members form, applying the same principles as in the main system.</i>

Figure 9: <i>Coupling of the main and the i1 networks. The main network is depicted
in black with circular nodes while the i1 network is depicted in green with hexagonal
nodes. The stations painted here are those of the main network, remarking how in each station there
is always present an immunity member of i1. We can see a side note pointing to the
possibility of building further immunity networks, i2, i3 and so on, in order to 
reinforce the robustness of the whole system. For now we will try only with i1, but
if necessary we can build the others. If they were to be created, they would have
again the same structure as the other two, and the coupling would be very simple: the
i(n+1) network would couple to the i(n) network as the i1 would couple to the main system. </i>
