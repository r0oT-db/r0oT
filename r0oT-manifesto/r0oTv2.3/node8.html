Figure 6: <i>Depiction of local vs global democracy. What affects a single 
station is voted in the station. What affects a branch must be voted by the 
whole branch. What affects the whole network must be voted by everyone. On the
right we have depicted some branches with dashed red lines. Branches always stem
from a specific station. Local
democracy allows the system to be very efficient while at the same time
to be democratic, but global democracy ensures that the same principles are
applied everywhere. Only in a world where the rights and obligations are
the same to everyone we can speak of true justice and democracy. In our
current world, there are many different countries with many different sets
of rights and laws, and it is not just that some are more fortunate than
others by the mere accident of being born here or there: it is that in the
countries with more `freedom' and `rights', we take advantage of the other
`lesser' countries to have cheap workers under unfair conditions so we can
obtain cheap and nice goods to buy. In this context, Gaia, the Earth, is the
last country on the list, the country that nobody takes care of, the one
that offers the cheapest products. We need to revert this order and put
Gaia first. </i>

At this point you may have wondered whether someone joining r0oT in the first place remains
forever there, or whether someone joining r0oT in the future at layer 13 but with the
will of participating at inner layers must be stuck at 13. The answer is a clear no. In the
growth process we will allocate people by arriving order, but these are only initial 
conditions that will have nothing to do with the dynamic equilibrium that has to be acquired
afterwards. For example, some people interested in r0oT may join at the first stages but
then realize that their interests are more close to the local people. Of course, they
can move to more external layers. If someone wants to remain in the same layer
but changing station, it can be done as well. There are no better or worse positions, only
more abstract or more practical places, more global or more local.
Everyone can target the layer that suits better to her/him.

<P>
Have you ever noticed how left-wing parties are more democratic but extremely
inefficient, with their never ending and chaotic assemblies, 
while right-wing parties, with their disciplined hierarchies, are less democratic but 
more efficient? At the end, take a look at the world now and guess who is winning:
 democracy or efficiency?
Even when a left party wins an election, it is only a matter of time that it moves
to the right when it seeks more efficient structures and mechanisms.
In r0oT, however, we can combine the good of both approaches, by building a network which
already provides the efficiency and a democratic dynamics to give to people
the real power. Specifically, we articulate two types of democracy: local and
global. Local democracy is very simple: it consists in voting each decision
that a station makes, where the voters are simply all the station members. This
is fast, practical and very efficient. But not universal.

Reports are not the end of the story in the discussion of r0oT.
Each station must also work to have a set of 
recommendations or principles for its whole stemming branch.
 Maybe in the future these sets can substitute
real world laws. It is too soon now to talk in these terms, but if r0oT works, why not? If
politics is about coordinating actions to act for the global good of people, isn't
r0oT a political structure? Surely it is, but it is not clear whether in some
future it can or cannot substitute real politic powers. For now, each station,
instead of rules or laws, will simply write some principles, to be divulged 
through its stemming branches. They will never be imposed, but they need to be
taught, discussed, understood and eventually changed.
Ideally, at the most inner layers, a collection of human rights and <I>human
obligations</I> should be written, and approved by all. The point of global
 democracy is that any change in these station principles
or recommendations must be voted by global democracy, by all the members
stemming from that station. If it is something related to the principles of
s1.1, then everyone must vote to approve a change. In local and global
democracy in r0oT, every change must be approved by a majority of at least
2/3 of the total. Otherwise the issue remains unchanged. Finally, every
principle stated in a station must be compatible with the principles
stated in inner stations, so equality and universality are ensured. In Figure <A HREF="#fig06">6</A>
we depict the graphical difference between local and global democracy.

<P>
Another aspect very related to democracy is mobility. At least each 28 days, each
station will vote for its new (or re-elected) station agent. The election
will be among those who are willing to be such agent, unless nobody wants to be, 
so all of them become candidates. An agent can also declare that she/he does not want
to be voted. With this mechanism we acquire radial mobility, and people
more suited to inner layers can penetrate the onion while people with
more local and practical nature can go to a layer of his/her satisfaction.
But of course, to go to inner layers, other members must allow you to do
so. Angular mobility will imply the permutation of two members of two different
and closely located stations of the same layer, upon mutual agreement. In Figure
<A HREF="#fig07">7</A> we depict these processes.
