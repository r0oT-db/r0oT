<P>
Joining r0oT at this first stage is very simple. Just follow these steps and you will be in:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Download the Tor Browser [<A
 HREF="node12.html#tor">70</A>] for your operating system (OS). Needless to say that in r0oT we should
promote open source and free OS like Linux. But don't worry, Tor
Browser is available for most systems. You can even use Tails, an OS devoted to Tor and privacy [<A
 HREF="node12.html#tails">71</A>]. Tor will allow people from countries where Internet
suffers high levels of censorship [<A
 HREF="node12.html#censorship">72</A>] to participate in r0oT.
</LI>
<LI>Open Tor Browser, go to Tutanota [<A
 HREF="node12.html#tutanota">64</A>] and sign up with an invented nick without giving 
any personal information. Currently, Tutanota allows signing up from Tor. That is why
we recommend it. Tutanota, a service with a free plan choice and being open source, provides a simple way of sending and receiving encrypted emails in a clear interface without having to worry about these issues.
Once inside the network we will try to develop and enhance better ways of communication, for example i2p [<A
 HREF="node12.html#i2p">65</A>], GNUnet [<A
 HREF="node12.html#gnunet">73</A>], Freenet [<A
 HREF="node12.html#freenet">74</A>], Bitmessage [<A
 HREF="node12.html#bitmessage">75</A>] ...so programmers are more than welcome at the first stages.
</LI>
<LI>Write an email to r0oT@tutanota.com (notice the number 0 followed by the letter o) or to any other entry email available. Briefly
explain, in simple English, your motivations to enter, without revealing any personal
information. You can also explain how could you help at the first stage of r0oT, which is
growth. 
</LI>
<LI>It is better not to attach any document, but if you do, pass it through the MAT [<A
 HREF="node12.html#mat">76</A>] software before sharing it. It helps to clear the meta-data in it, which could expose your identity.
</LI>
<LI>In the email, show your preference between joining the main r0oT and joining the immunity i1 network. Remember, if you consider yourself a Gaia warrior, choose to enter i1. 
</LI>
<LI>If you are already in the network and this is your second joining email in order to join
a specialist network, use a different nick and address from the one you use at the main network, and tell us your main specialty, and whether you want to be in the specialty network or in its associated immunity network. Choose the later if you feel especially concerned about the corruption in science or in other technical areas.
</LI>
<LI>Wait for a reply. If it does not arrive after a week, try to find other entry addresses. 
</LI>
<LI>Once you enter, you will receive further instructions. Basically, you will go to a brief
apprenticeship stage of some weeks to familiarize with the details of the system. Try to keep
yourself active or reconsider your participation. An inactive member block and harms the
whole process.
</LI>
<LI>If you happen to log in into your account from another browser different than Tor, do not
use it again for r0oT. Open a new one and inform your station.
</LI>
<LI>Don't use institutional computers (administration, universities, etc), or other computers
from your work. Avoid connecting at places with high surveillance.
</LI>
<LI>Don't use your mobile or cell phone for r0oT.
</LI>
<LI>After you enter, try to divulge this project and open entry door addresses, without revealing your nicks in r0oT.  
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If you have a more technical profile you may want to set up an i2p [<A
 HREF="node12.html#i2p">65</A>] service and contact us
through bote email at our i2p address [<A
 HREF="node12.html#address">1</A>] or at other addresses that we can provide in the future. The i2p network is, in theory, ideal for r0oT and we will
try to promote and improve it, but from the inside, as it is not trivial to set it up.  
If the main entry emails that we provide are closed or compromised and you
find yourself in the need for looking somewhere else to enter, how can you be sure
that you enter the authentic r0oT network and not into another one which could be formed
by malicious people with suspicious interests, or simply for trolling? We think the answer is quite simple: there is
no perfect way to give an authenticity signature of r0oT while keeping it anonymous. Instead,
follow your instinct. If there is someone caring for Gaia and humanity as a whole, she/he will
not begin another parallel network because having 2 copies of r0oT will only increase the
disorder we already have. If someone asks or offers you money or other material profit,
or see ads, you are in the wrong network. If you find that the informaction flowing 
there is suspicious, report it to your corresponding i1 
member, and if immediate action is not taken against this, exit the network. If there is no activity, you are in the wrong network. If you find a self-called `r0oT project' or similar trying to put
 a server in r0oT, a kind of `facer0oT', where you log in and have all the mechanisms in an integrated web page, don't join, or exit if you are already in, because with a global server
we would not be true peer-to-peer (P2P) and our vulnerability would increase dramatically. Indeed, it
would be more comfortable to have a system in which all the details would be automatic, 
but this would mean to
put r0oT in hands of the current powers. By staying low-tech and P2P we will be much difficult
to track and control. Maybe in some future we can design a custom, serverless network,
to adapt to the needs of r0oT, but for now we will stick to simple emails, and wherever
there is no Internet available, by direct contact or simple mail. Unfortunately, right
now is not possible to join the first stage of r0oT without Internet and an email account. 
But at least, sticking to simple emails we will reach much further than with other high-tech 
approaches.

<P>
A final word: many people will criticize r0oT for being a utopia. But think about this term,
`utopia', how it is in fact a meme whose mission is to discourage everyone from taking action
to change the world. It is true that this system has some complicated features, but this is
nothing compared to the much greater sophistication of, for example, building a big airplane,
 or manage all 
the airports details and the air traffic. And no one think that as a utopia because you can see how
is perfectly working at every city with clock precision. Why, then, should we allow the meme
 `utopia' to manipulate our minds
and behavior, to freeze us in front of the enormous need to action, as toxoplasmosis do to mice? [<A
 HREF="node12.html#toxo">77</A>] Come on, we can do better than that. Don't turn a blind eye to this, and don't expect
others to save the world for you. Get your feet wet or they will end up drown. Join r0oT. Now.
