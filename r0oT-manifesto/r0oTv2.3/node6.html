processing and transmission</A>
</H1>

<P>
In r0oT, informaction is processed in stations in the form of <I>reports</I> and they
are mainly transmitted through the Internet, usually through relatively secure
email services like Tutanota [<A
 HREF="node12.html#tutanota">64</A>] or i2p secure mail [<A
 HREF="node12.html#i2p">65</A>]. The idea is simple: a station
receives a report from another neighbor station, so the members and the agent
have some time to process and resend it to their own neighboring stations.
Each report can contain information alone or include proposals of direct action as well, so both
aspects have to be dealt with. Once the action is performed and the information is processed,
the station forwards the updated report. Where? There are four directions in which reports
are received and sent. First: angular flows, where we communicate with our two next-neighbors
in our same layer. Not a big processing is required to forward in angular directions, because
both belong to the same radius or layer in the overall `onion'. The angular direction has
two variants: clockwise and counterclockwise. If we receive a report clockwise, we forward it
clockwise, and the same for the opposite sign of rotation. Radial directions are more elaborated,
since they involve a change of layer. Reports travel radially in two ways: outwards and inwards.
If we receive a report that comes from an inner layer, then we propagate it outwards. But
if we receive it from an outer layer, we propagate it inwards and also outwards to those branches
where it did not come from (notice that a station will receive an inward report from just
one of the many branches it connects, so we need to propagate the message outwards to the others).
Apart from all this, the informaction needs to be transformed when it changes layers. The
most inner layers will deal with more abstract, universal concepts, while outer layers
will need to deal with informaction in a more practical, direct fashion, and always adapted
to local idiosyncrasies like for example local languages or cultures. Global, inner layers will use
simple English to communicate while local layers can use local languages.
 It is then necessary for the station to adapt the contents of
the reports to the layer it targets, and only with time we will all learn how to do this well, what
is more appropriate for each layer.
Of course, each report will reflect the history of previous reports on a given topic, for
everyone to check its evolution and detect possible manipulations. Furthermore, reports
can be merged and split as needed. 

<P>
Each report will come with a priority number (PN), from 1 to 4. If PN=1, it means the report
has slow speed of transmission. This does not mean that it is not important. On the contrary: a very important
topic needs longer times to be thought, discussed and processed. So if PN=1, the station must
forward its processed report within 28 days. If PN=2, we have a medium speed report,
in which the station has 14 days. The propagation speed will increase but the quality of
processing may be lower. PN=3 will imply fast mode, with 24 hours to resend it. Finally,
PN=4 will imply maximum speed priority, in which almost no processing will be done. Depending
on the topic, sometimes speed will be more important than processing, or the opposite. The
relevant thing to understand here is that we cannot maximize both speed and processing.
PN numbers can change in the course
of its travel along the network, but the details of this, as with many other topics, are not
the goal of this introductory text. In Figure <A HREF="#fig05">5</A> we show some of the details of
informaction speed and processing as well as other aspects of the network.

Figure 5: <i>Infographic of some details of the r0oT network. The three left color circles represent
the angular and radial flows that informaction acquires. The black circles on the left show what
we mean by angular and radial directions. In the middle column we find the
numbers of how many people can be in each layer, as well as the percentage of the current total
population of about 7.4 billion people. Notice how, reaching layer 11 we could acquire a high
degree of coordination while involving about half of 1\%. We have also depicted two radial
arrows representing the radial gradient of abstraction/specificity that can naturally appear in the
network. Inner layers will probably tend to deal with more global topics while outer
layers will probably deal with more local, direct, practical subjects. However,
the structure of r0oT is thought in such a way that inner layers also act as propagators
of local topics while local layers act as promoters of global issues. 
There is also a radial arrow depicting locality. This means that the network has global
inner layers, with their members as mixed as possible throughout the world, while
external layers will engineered to be local, where network neighbors will be also real world
neighbors. Four colored radial arrows represent the 4 speeds and processing depths
of the reports: green for slow speed and high processing, yellow for medium speed
and medium processing, orange for high speed and low processing and red for maximum
speed and minimum processing. Every choice has a price. Now we move to what most people, in
layer 13, will experience by participating in r0oT.</i>
