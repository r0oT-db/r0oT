specialists</A>

<P>
There is only one missing piece left in this system: the technical, specialist
knowledge. We, regular people, are specialists in normally one, maybe two
disciplines, if any. We need the knowledge of the professionals. Surely they will
be there, somewhere scattered through the network, but we need them to be
coordinated as well and with close interaction with society. And even more
importantly: we need an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">uncorrupted</SPAN> knowledge. We cannot depend on the
technical advice that some people give us while they depend on money given by
the current powers. This is happening today in science [<A
 HREF="node12.html#tudge">66</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#tudgeb">67</A>].
 If a voice is raised
against some interests, it is easily cut on funds. We need, for example, the hugely
important knowledge of farmers [<A
 HREF="node12.html#goodfood">68</A>], but without the filters of economic interests
of the giant biotech companies or the big agribusiness corporations. We need to
discuss once and for all whether we should expand our nuclear fission energy use or not,
a type of energy that is usually rejected by big environmental NGO's and general public
but which has a very low degree of carbon dioxide emissions[<A
 HREF="node12.html#lovelock2">33</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#lovelock3">19</A>].  More over, 
we cannot allow that a big proportion of the knowledge that originates
 from public funding ends locked under private journals[<A
 HREF="node12.html#nature2">69</A>]. Many scientists
need to change their attitudes and have the will to publish <I>for</I> Nature.  

<P>
That is why we create the specialist networks. The details are a bit complicated,
so here we describe just the essentials. For each discipline of knowledge or craft
we will create a network, with almost the same structure as always. They will be
connected by stations, and with all the dynamics described before. And they will
have an immunity network dedicated to each of them, so if we create the network
of farmers we create as well the associated i1 farmers network, and so on. In this
case, it is important that you join r0oT twice, one as a regular or i1 member, and
another as a specialist in your main discipline, or as an i1 member of your main
discipline, as you prefer. Once a specialist network is created, is coupled
to the main network as depicted in Figure <A HREF="#fig10">10</A>. 



<P>
The engineering of specialist networks is a bit complicated, but the idea is that each specialist
network will be visiting a branch at each time, with one specialist per main station
temporarily present at such branch. During those visits, there can be an exchange between
society and technical communities. We think that these networks can benefit not only society but 
also the specialist community involved in it. There is an immediate and direct
 self-benefit by the mere fact of being organized. The visiting system consists in staying some time at one
branch, and then jump (angularly) to the next. During that time, main and specialist reports
can reflect the interaction between both networks. Specialists need to be in contact
with society and society with specialists, in a direct way. The role of a specialists
in a main station, as visitors, is to collect information from the main members and also
to tell how their specialty can contribute to the problems of society. The problems
of the specialty can also be passed to society, for example the need for more funding
or more social recognition, or their importance to specific problems. It can also be
fun and refreshing to learn from many different specialties just for the sake of knowledge.

<P>
As a specialist network grows in number, it will increase its degree. The details of this
metamorphosis are quite complicated to be discussed here. A final and important point in this topic
is that the technical knowledge does not always need to be so compartmentalized as it is usually
the case.  For example, a chemist and a physicist can benefit from
interacting, and physics and chemistry in general can improve too.
 The specialists networks can organize mutual visits or couplings
if they wish, or if recommended by the main network. Knowledge is sometimes better
when not compartmentalized,
as sometimes very important things are lost at the frontiers between different fields.
That is why when creating the specialists networks, a hierarchy of disciplines needs
to be created, by categories and subcategories. For example, the physics and chemistry
network members will also belong to the science sp network. There is no need to subdivide
categories ad infinitum because that would mean a lot of implication of sp members, having
to visit too many stations at once. The hierarchy needs just to ensure that there is not
a harmful and excessive sub categorization as sometimes happens and that
some level of constructive mixing is put into practice. For example, ecology + teaching,
 or technology + philosophy
could provide great insights if they would periodically couple together. 
The principal idea is that each main station
can be frequently visited by experts who can provide
a fruitful and necessary exchange. This, in short, will dramatically increase the efficiency
of global coordination and will try to avoid corruption in the technical world, a serious
disease we suffer today. We need to acknowledge the fact that the big problems that we need
to face need a strong social coordination between people and also the implication of the
technical, scientific and crafts communities in order to search, find and execute intelligent
and wise solutions.

Figure 10: <i>Specialist networks. We show 7 different specialist networks. We don't
show nomenclature even if it is simple enough: add a `sp' as a prefix and follow the
usual nomenclature. Immunity-specialist networks are only shown in the orange network,
and we don't show nomenclature either, which would have
the prefix spi1. As a suffix, all of them will have the name of the specialty. For
example, we may have sp.2.3.farming, which is the 2.3 node of the farming network.
Or sps.3.2.biology, which is the 3.2 station of the biology network. And so on. Notice
how there is a specialist at each station at a given visited branch. And notice as well
how the visits jump from one branch to the next in a counterclockwise angular fashion.
Depending on how many members the network has, it has a greater or lower degree, which
just indicates the main layer at which it attaches.  </i>
