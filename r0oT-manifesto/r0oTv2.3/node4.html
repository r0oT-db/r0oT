<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
growth</A>
</H1> 
Here is where the real action begins. We have chosen a 
factorial [<A
 HREF="node12.html#factorial">25</A>] branching network because it allows to encapsulate almost all 
human population in just 13 layers of organization, where each member 
interacts with very few people. This allows great global efficiency 
through a fast and practical local interaction. The network grows 
in the following manner. First, people who are interested simply follow the 
steps, described in the last section, to contact us, so they can 
join. Then, they are immediately allocated to nodes of the network by arriving order. 
First we fill the layer 1, in which there is just one person. Then 
the second layer, in which only two people are required. Then the third 
layer, with 6 people, the fourth layer, with 24 people, and so on. It is 
a factorial network because each layer n has n! members, where ! is the 
factorial operation that you can find in almost every decent calculator. 
The connectivity is as follows: the first member, called 1.1, will 
connect with 2 members of layer 2, which are 2.1 and 2.2. Each of these 
2 people will connect with 3 more people. Each of the six people in 
layer 3 will connect with 4 more people, and so on. By the time we reach 
layer 13, almost all people on Earth are connected. In Figure 
<A HREF="#fig03">3</A> we have depicted the first steps of the growth process. 
Notice as well how stations are formed. A station is the small group or 
unit of people where things are discussed and reports are processed (more on this later).
The name comes from (metaphorically) thinking the network as a city underground transportation system, 
connecting all the world in a fast and efficient way. 
Each station has a 
coordinator, or station agent, while the rest are called station members. The 
agent is not a dictatorial boss but just a coordinator. As we will describe later, 
all matters discussed in a station will be subject to voting where all 
votes, including the agent's, have the same weight. Notice also that 
each person in the network belongs to 2 stations, one as station agent 
and another as member. The exceptions are those in layer 13, who are only 
station members (although they can be agents of extra stations, as we 
will see), and member 1.1 who is only agent of station s1.1. People thinking
that node 1.1 is the big boss of the world are quite wrong: this node can
only be in contact with the 2 people in her/his station. As we will see,
people from inner layers cannot broadcast messages to the whole population,
as that would be against the philosophy of r0oT.  

<P>



<P>
The process of growth is hard because there will not be many people 
receiving the news that this project even exists. And even if it arrives to them,
 it may be through some media who perceives this system as a 
threat so the message can be corrupted. For example, we can be accused 
of being a ridiculous and fraudulent pyramid scheme, or even labeled as 
dangerous terrorists only because we use anonymizing networks.
Whatever they can think to discredit the project and block 
its development, which of course would not benefit them, they will try. We can also 
reach you through friends or local spreading like dead drops [<A
 HREF="node12.html#deaddrops">26</A>] or other 
free channels. It is important that we all propagate the message of this 
project,
 but it is hard to reach the total population. As is usual in networks and nonlinear
phenomena [<A
 HREF="node12.html#strogatz">27</A>], there is probably a critical stage at which our growth can be explosive 
and unstoppable, but until 
then, it can be hard and fragile. But we think we have to try it 
anyway. There is too much at stake. The initial 
members will be allocated directly by us, the founders of r0oT, 
but the idea is that each new member opens email addresses that can 
be used as entry doors as well. We, the founders, will not directly participate in the 
network until the fourth layer is completed, so we can rapidly dilute in the network. 
And even then, all the 
members will participate anonymously, or at least with some degree of 
anonymity. At least the first 
9 layers need this in order to operate without being 
easily identified [<A
 HREF="node12.html#umbrella">28</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#victim1">29</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#victim2">30</A>]. Now you can ask: OK, we the people are the nodes of 
the network, an underground system formed by connected stations where the links are relatively secured 
by anonymizing tools such as encrypted emails, but what it is that flows through 
the whole system? In blood vessels we have blood, in respiratory systems 
we have air, in rivers water, in plants sap. What is the liquid or gas 
that flows in r0oT?

Figure 3: <i>Growth of the first 5 layers of the r0oT network. Circles 
are nodes, occupied by a single person. Lines are connections, who will 
be performed through emails or other means of communication. In gray we 
mark some stations, the units of discussion and action. From left to 
right and top to bottom: 1.Layer 1 is formed by a single person, the 
node 1.1. Notice the nomenclature: the first digit indicates layer, 
while the second is for the membership within the layer. 2.The second 
layer involves two people, the nodes 2.1 and 2.2. Notice that the three 
depicted members form the first station, s1.1. The nomenclature for 
stations is as follows: first begin with `s', which denotes station, and 
then the name or address of the station agent. 3.In the third layer we 
add 6 more people, 3 of them to one branch and the other 3 to another 
branch. 4.The fourth layer involves 24 new people, spread in 6 
stations. 5.The fifth people needs 120 new people to be spread 
in 24 stations. Notice how rapidly the population grows in each layer. 
Pictures beyond layer 6 are almost unrenderable.</i>
