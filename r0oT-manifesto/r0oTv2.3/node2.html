<P>



<P>
This is not the place to analyze how the ecosystem is being heavily injured by humans [<A
 HREF="node12.html#climate">6</A>], or how too many of us 
and other species are in deplorable conditions. There are already some
good documentaries that show the current state of the art [<A
 HREF="node12.html#ten">7</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#flood">8</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#cow">9</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#truecost">10</A>] and there is no 
point in doing the same here. First of all, go and watch them and many others. They are excellent in showing what is happening or what may happen,
but they don't usually address the crucial issue of what can we do to prevent it and how. Of what to do when, shocked and convinced that 
something must be done, we
watch their end credits without knowing how to start, where to begin. Confused by the fact that even many
NGO's are silent about key issues as, for example, the need of a global change of diet. Stunned by a large amount of
disorganized information. Well, these problems are over. The project introduced in this text
is the necessary corollary to those other references, the place to go after you become angry by learning
how bad we are behaving and how ominous is our immediate future. Long story short: we don't trust that
governments will seriously follow the Paris Agreement [<A
 HREF="node12.html#paris">11</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#nature">12</A>] or will
take different courses of action in those issues that are really important, in a broad sense. They are too bound to their
particular interests to worry about Gaia or humanity in general. And we cannot wait for good politicians
to appear from nowhere. There are too many problems and too important that need to be faced right now. This 
has to be done by the civil society, by people, by you and us. If not, who else will? Yes, you have guessed it: we need to override governments and every
other layer of power that will oppose to change. And yes, without anarchy of any kind. We are more clever than that.
Anarchy, communism, capitalism...They are all <SPAN  CLASS="textit">obsolete.</SPAN> Current economy is to ecology what astrology is to
astronomy: old pseudosciences that just tell you what you want to listen, while taking your money afterwards. 
What you will find here is not a theoretical analysis of capitalism or a discussion about the environment:
instead, this is the 
place to find a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">practical proposal of action</SPAN> that targets the 
global problems you should already know. It is common to hear today: `what can I do 
alone?' and the true answer is that, alone, we can't do anything, at least 
not in a constructive way. We are currently in an over populated world where the degree 
of coordination between humans is extremely low, probably null, so small, heroic efforts contribute almost nothing
to the global average. Our combined force equals to zero, or a very small 
quantity compared with the well coordinated actions of the powers now in 
charge. A disorganized humanity clearly benefits these powers, so they will work 
hard against any attempt of a global coordination in order maintain their status quo. They know that no one
 can stand a single chance against 
a coordinated humanity. Our latent, hidden collective force is too great 
to encounter the slightest opposition. The challenge is, then, to achieve such a coordinated 
state. This is the main goal of r0oT: to provide humanity with a 
structure, a skeleton to our muscle, an order to our anger. That will allow to start acting globally to 
our own real, broad and long term interest.

<P>
So, essentially, this text is about what to do and how, and it is meaningful once you know what is happening and how serious is it.
It is no secret that most of the main activities of r0oT will target the 
problem of the climate crisis and the (very related) problem of poverty. 
It is no secret either that we need to immediately stop human population growth 
and to gently reduce it, to dramatically change our diet in order to stop 
one of the main reasons of global warming, animal agriculture [<A
 HREF="node12.html#cow">9</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#worldwatch">13</A>,<A
 HREF="node12.html#numbers">14</A>], and
also to cut our dependence on fossil fuels...We also need to enhance critical 
thinking in order to have a world with hard-to-manipulate humans, so concepts as 
nations and frontiers can be weakened in favor of others like world-scale laws. If you wonder how
such inconvenient leaders rise to power with the votes of people, here is the answer: lack of critical
thinking. This is something that needs to be learned, to be taught in schools and at home. Think about it:
 we write a collection of human rights without taking into account the protection of the rest of Nature, of our fellow creatures on Earth, 
our ecosystem, or Gaia if you prefer. Only minds without critical thinking can accept such a nonsense. The human rights cannot  be 
a reality until they are accompanied by its necessary counterpart: 
the human obligations [<A
 HREF="node12.html#lovelock3">19</A>]. We have big responsibilities, towards Gaia and 
towards humanity as a whole. It is time to mature as a species, to acknowledge that we
have duties. Our first one is, then, becoming 
coordinated to unfold the power that lies within people. In Figure 
<A HREF="#fig01">1</A> we have pictured a little toy model for the need of 
coordination. The main question, however, is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">how can we actually achieve it?</SPAN>

Figure 1 (caption) <i>Toy model for the need of human coordination. We have 
depicted a chamber separated in two parts by a moving piston. On the 
left there are many disordered arrows pointing at random directions. The 
arrows represent forces, so for total randomness the total 
force becomes zero. The temperature on the left is high, which means a great reservoir of
energy but in an unusable form. On the right we have represented four single forces, 
the main powers now in charge of the world, in a perfectly coordinated push 
to have most of the chamber (the world or its wealth) available for them. The temperature
on the right is clearly very low, without any hint of randomness. On the left 
part of the chamber there is still some space left because the 
disorganized forces produce some pressure, which is transmitted to the piston, as molecules in 
a gas do. If the right-arrows push too hard, the temperature on the left 
part of the chamber increases even more and so does its pressure, until some 
suffocating equilibrium is achieved. If the temperature of the left arrows increases 
for whatever reasons, as in a violent revolution, its pressure over the right-arrows increases as well, 
and humanity can gain some part of the chamber, but not much. What 
humanity, and the whole ecosystem needs is a de-thermalization of the 
left-arrows, so they can become perfectly organized, pushing to the right. You 
are probably one of these left-arrows right now, so why not aligning with 
the rest and start doing the right thing? If we achieve this 
state, the whole chamber will be available to all, and the current 
powers will be modified in such a way that they will work for the whole, 
not for a separate space of their own. So, instead of growing hot, in a revolutionary way, humanity needs a 
rational cooling until it freezes to a non-random situation. A smooth renaissance with critical thinking as
our main tool. We need to 
stop our lives for a moment, think with cold minds, and realize that hot responses are not 
efficient. Of course, not responding is not an option either! Only a pacific and illustrated transition from disorder to order is able to overcome 
the problems that otherwise will strangle us. But how is such a difficult and necessary transition achieved?</i>
