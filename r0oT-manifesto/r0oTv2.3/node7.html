Until now we have essentially described r0oT from the inner layer perspective. This is
natural because what we need to do first is growth from within. However, the most
interesting aspects of this network occur at external layers.
At these layers, people participating
in neighboring nodes will be close neighbors in the physical world too. But
living spatially in the same building or street does not necessarily make us
acquaintances. There is
a lack of interaction between people living at a common place, especially
in big cities, and such a cold distance only enhances incoordination
even more. This, as problems grow harder, will need to change. People living close to each 
other share a great deal of needs and interests, like running water, food supply, residue
 management, etc, and probably share the same fate.
 Currently there are many cooperatives that try to bring solutions
 to local problems,
but in general we don't see, at least in big cities, a strong sense of community.
 With r0oT this should
change, since it promotes a strong interaction and cooperation between actual neighbors. It is
quite desirable, for example, to buy food directly from local farmers, or even to produce your 
own, to actively participate on what and how is taught at local 
schools, to make use of solar energy from all building roofs, to increase the support on people
with tough difficulties, to directly manage the space by maximizing vegetation and supporting
local fauna, to become rebels that substitute the asphalt streets by orchards and trees,
to talk to other neighbors to inform them on what we all need to face, to block the entrance
and use of any damaging product or the application of a damaging policy from the local 
laws. To take over our space and convert it into a place as personal, sustainable and 
coordinated as possible. We neighbors need to be strongly coordinated to be strong towards
the future. And r0oT provides the structure for the interaction that such cohesion requires.

<P>
An additional feature of r0oT is that already existing local associations that are not part
of our system can bind them to the main network in a simple way. Each association needs
to nominate a representative member to be the link as a 13 member. Then, the informaction
originating in such association can travel through r0oT, while informaction from
r0oT can reach the association as well. Examples of this can be labor or trade unions,
neighbor associations, parents grouping together to deal with children related issues,
etc We call these attached groups `extra stations' or `extrations'.  

<P>
The general idea here is that r0oT has a double purpose from the local perspective. On
the one hand, inner layers act as propagators of local problems and as active actors
towards finding solutions. For example, a factory somewhere could not be paying fairly to
some workers, or is doing some injustice of any kind. This needs to be traduced to a
r0oT informaction impulse that will escalate to inner layers. From them, global actions
could be proposed, like the blocking of the company's products until the problem
is properly repaired. But on the other hand, there are global problems that only
through a powerful channel can reach each place and person in the world. For example,
we all need to know what are the real data and expectations for the future concerning
the climate crisis. Without r0oT, this information is not arriving to everyone in a clear
way. In short, a strong coordination like the one r0oT proposes allows every person and 
creature to have a universal voice that will be heard by everyone, while at the same time allows
global issues to have voice and be heard at every home.
