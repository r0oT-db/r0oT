<P>
It is estimated that, while the number of people on 
Earth is about 10<sup>9</sup>, the number of cells in our bodies is over 10<sup>13</sup>, about then thousand times more. Yet all cells receive their necessary 
nutrients while a huge proportion of humans don't even receive running water, not
to mention proper food and education, Internet, etc. Why is so? A 
geneticist [<A
 HREF="node12.html#selfish">21</A>] could answer: because all cells in a body share the same 
genes [<A
 HREF="node12.html#alberts">22</A>], so all have the same interests, while humans, each with a small 
genetic variance, compete to impose their little differences in the gene pool. Well, 
this explains why Nature has selected coordinated cells in a body but 
not coordinated individuals in a species...until now. 
We may have little genetic differences between us, but 
isn't the common genetic percentage much greater? In fact, all living species on 
Earth share a great deal of genetic material, which means that all are 
our family. We are all fruits from the same family tree, daughters and sons of a common ancestor. Right now, as we have reached the ceiling of Earth's resources,
the main pressure is on such tree as a whole, instead of the relative smaller pressure for selecting gene A or 
B in a particular branch. In conclusion, either we learn to fight together, for life in general,
or we are almost all dead in no time. Right now, all living beings share 
the same interest: to prevent Gaia from moving to a deadly state, so we should
all work together. We are today like cells in a body: mutually depending on the overall success. That is how selection pressure have become binary: either
we all survive or we all die. Genes, as blind molecules, may not be directly aware of this, of course, but minds are. Minds with critical thinking are. And
if minds are phenotypes of our genes, our genes also know what is at stake, or at least they totally depend on our immediate actions.

So how do cells reach such great coherence, which is what we need for our population? The answer is connectivity 
and branching. Our vascular vessels branch until they reach every cell 
to provide them blood rich in nutrients and collect used blood for 
recycling and recirculation. Our nervous system branches until all our body is provided 
with stimuli and receptors. The air that we breath is collected at the 
trachea and branches to the bronchi and later to the bronchioles. Then 
it goes to terminal bronchioles and finally to the respiratory 
bronchioles, where direct contact with red blood cells is possible [<A
 HREF="node12.html#air">23</A>].
 All achieved by recursive branching. Out from our bodies, rivers use branching to collect to 
water until it reaches the sea. Snowflakes grow doing branching as well. 
Trees and plants in general develop branches, and also use branching in leave distribution and even the nerves of leaves. 
And of course, in roots, the inspiration for the name of this project. The 
reason is that, at least for some time, our coordination system will 
have to operate underground, as usually roots do, because the surface is currently dominated by other 
forces. There are many other examples of branching, and not only in 
Nature. An important disclaimer to be done here is that r0oT is not like 
one of those fraudulent pyramid schemes, illegal in many countries, in which 
people ask you for money with the false promise that you will receive 
more in the future [<A
 HREF="node12.html#scheme">24</A>]. Here in r0oT no one can ask you for money or 
other material properties. That would be absurd. In Figure <A HREF="#fig02">2</A> we have summarized these 
examples by always using the same schematic and simplified branching. Notice however 
that Nature allows for many different systems of branching. We, for 
r0oT, need to choose one of them, and start growing it. It is always wise to copy what Nature has been
doing so successfully for millions of years. Let's begin.

Figure 2: <i>Simplified schematics of branching examples. From left to 
right and up to bottom: 1.Trees develop branches and leaves exhibit 
branched nerve systems. Roots also are branched. In general, plants 
usually grow and develop using fractal-like branching systems. 2.Rivers 
converge until huge quantities of water are collected and delivered back to the sea. 
3.Air in lungs goes through a sophisticated branched system to bring 
oxygen molecules and expel carbon dioxide to and from every single red 
blood cell. 4.Fraudulent pyramid schemes follow branching structures as 
well, but don't be afraid because r0oT is not one of these frauds. You can join and check this by yourself. 
5.Blood reaches each cell of our bodies and is collected from each of them 
thanks to an extremely branched system of arteries and veins: the 
circulatory system. 6.Snowflakes are beautiful examples of branching and 
symmetry. A good metaphor of what we need today: a coldly planned growth following a beautiful pattern to bring the ice poles back on Earth. 
The question is, how can we exactly grow such an ambitious structure?</i>
