<P>
This is a proposal of action aimed to everyone concerned by climate crisis and other world scale problems. The idea is to build a non-profit, P2P and anonymous network with a tree-like structure
in which everyone can be integrated in just 13 layers of branching. Only through a high degree of coordination can humanity overcome the crisis that we all need to face. r0oT is essentially a network in which every person joining
becomes a node interacting with its closest node-neighbors. Nodes are grouped in small cells that we call stations, which communicate by simple encrypted
emails or other secure messaging protocols. By periodic voting, members can also swap positions in the network so no one remains at the same place
for long. The whole point is that informaction (= information + action) can appear anywhere and then propagate through the system by using reports. A given report, our unit of informaction, will arrive to a station, where members will
have a given time to perform the proposed actions
and to study, discuss, contrast and process its contents before forwarding a new report version to next neighbor stations. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Encrypted reports flowing through a decentralized and serverless network of anonymous nodes that are randomly mixed through the whole world are very difficult to track and control by governments or other entities that can be against them, so everyone can have
access to free information, and with such information we, people, get the power, and true democracy can be finally accomplished.</SPAN> Only a single, global democracy
with global laws can be truly democratic. To work in this direction, inner layers, with
representatives from all places on Earth, will deal with
universal topics such as human rights and human obligations towards the ecosystem and the whole humanity, and with general principles that can provide a world-wide equality. More external layers will deal with increasingly practical and specific issues, so at the most external layers r0oT can act
as a local network of physically close neighbors. The system allows issues arising at a given location to be echoed to the whole network
until, if required, global responses are made to fix them, but at the same time global issues like climate crisis can be divulged and be present at each home.
<SPAN  CLASS="textit"> What is local can acquire a global reach and what is global can reach every location.</SPAN> Right now humanity is insanely working against its own ecosystem, Gaia, and against itself, because of our incoordination and because of the ill and manipulated information that we receive from almost everywhere. If
we manage to connect all people with this fractal-like structure, we can all learn what is really happening and find actions to
perform. If a government or a big company makes something that is bad for Gaia or humanity, and we happen to be all aware of it, a coordinated response
by people will force them to rectify. Most governments will not move
a finger for global issues because they depend on private interests. By acting together we can awake and unfold
the greatest transforming force on Earth and use it to look after Gaia and us, who are just part of her. In the text
we also discuss important topics as immunity (how the network protects itself from becoming corrupt), and specialists networks, where uncorrupted
and necessary technical knowledge can also flow and percolate through society. In brief, r0oT is a structure in which humanity can have access to free informaction
and learn from it. Consequently, by developing an increasingly stronger critical thinking, we can become free of the current manipulative powers now in charge. This may be the only escape from environmental and human disaster.
